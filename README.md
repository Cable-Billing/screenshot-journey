# Screenshot Journey

This addon is designed to help keep track of your journey through Azeroth.
Capturing key moments like level ups, achievement completions, and rare boss loot drops.

Inspired by the [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/) screenshot plugin for [Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Cable-Billing/screenshot-journey/releases/latest), download the `.zip` files and install it as you would any other addon.
