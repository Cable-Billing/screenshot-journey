# Screenshot Journey

This addon is designed to help keep track of your journey through Azeroth.
Capturing key moments like level ups, achievement completions, and rare boss loot drops.

Inspired by the [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/) screenshot plugin for [Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

Unfortunately due to the limitations that World of Warcraft has, screenshots cannot be spesificly named or put within spesific folders for organisation. Instead this just uses the screenshot functionality that can be used in-game, which just saves the screenshot to the `Screenshots` folder in your World of Warcraft directory with the current date timestamp. You will have to manage the organisation of the screenshots yourself.

## Compatability

This addon has been designed for the client for [Project Epoch](https://www.project-epoch.net/), but should work with any 3.3.5a World of Warcraft client.

## Installation

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Cable-Billing/screenshot-journey/releases/latest), download the `.zip` file and install it as you would any other addon.
